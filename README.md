> [!IMPORTANT]
> to deploy to cloudflare pages, see [this alternate repo](https://github.com/x8rr/cherri-cloudflare) for a deployable version. this repo does not include classplay store files, as they don't fit in cloudflare's 25 mb limit.

#### method 2: deploying locally

to get started, run the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/x8rr/cherri.git
```

now cd into the directory or just open it up

```sh
cd cherri
```

and finally start up a nice cool server

```sh
python3 -m http.server # cool python http server
netlify dev # to emulate a netlify prod environment
```

#### method 3: deploying to firebase

if you wanna deploy to firebase, make sure you have an account and a project you wanna use

to start, install firebase cli if you don't have it already

```sh
npm i -g firebase-tools
```

now initialize a pages project

```sh
firebase init hosting
```

follow the steps in the cli and deploy!

## if you fork...
please star the project :P

also make sure you dont do the following:
- modify the agpl license
- claim this code as yours
- not give adequate credits
- use this in your website without credits
- detatch from fork network without giving credits
- do anything that violates the license
- literally just steal this and run away with it

but you can:
- deploy it without any changes made
- deploy it WITH changes (as long as credit is included and changes are included)
- some more other stuff that i cant remember

i recommend including this to stay safe:
